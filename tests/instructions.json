After studying all of the items, you will be prompted to recall each definition by typing it into a short answer box. You will then indicate to what degree you think your answer is correct by marking it as 'fully correct,' 'partially correct,' or 'incorrect'. At the end of the experiment, there will be a few final questions for you to answer. Please do not write anything down, do not click the back button on your browser, and do not open other tabs or browsers during the experiment. Thank you for your participation!
