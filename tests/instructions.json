  "text": "In the next part of the experiment, you will be asked to recall the definitions you previously studied. You will see a question on the screen telling you which definition to recall along with a short answer box where you may write your answer. After writing down each defintion, you will be asked to indicate to what degree you think your answer is correct by marking it as 'fully correct,' 'partially correct,' or incorrect.' Answers that are fully correct signify responses that are 100% coorect, whereas partially correct answers are those that are between 40 and 99 percent accurate. If you believe your response is less than 40% accurate, mark it as incorrect. You will have to spend at least 10 seconds trying to recall the definition. You may spend more than 10 seconds recalling if you want to. We realize that this is a difficult task, but try to recall as much of the definition as you can. When 10 seconds is over, you may advance by pressing the 'Continue' button.
